# Use string concatenation to combine the variables and print the phrase

"""
# string concatenation [joining or combination of strings and values]

# variables [w is for word]
w1 = "Coding"
w2 = "Is"
w3 = "Cool"
# these variables are values stored in a string arrangement

# using operators to add variables
print(w1 + w2 + w3)
# using empty quotation marks with a space separates
print(w1 + " " + w2 + " " + w3)
# alternatively you can use commas to separate, because "," automatically adds a space after a variable
print(w1,w2,w3)
# examples of f-strings
print(f"Coding {w2} Cool!")
# f-strings is a format that looks cleaner to the eyes for most coders
# this simplifies the layout and using "{}" will read a variable inside that bracket

# Coding is Cool
